# Logging

The Azure Cosmos Repository follows the [high performance logging guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging/loggermessage?view=aspnetcore-6.0) making use of `LoggerMessage` throughout the library.

This page details what logs we offer and also what `EventId` ranges we have chosen to use.

## Event ID Ranges

Since this library is making use of `EventId`'s each message we log falls within a range. We have split this range based on the common logging levels you would be use to seeing in any normal applications using `ILogger`. See the ranges below.


| Log Level                               | `EventId` range                         |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Debug/Verbose                           |  15000 - 15100                          |
| Information                             |  15101 - 15200                          |
| Critical                                |  15401 - 15500                          |
| Warning                                 |  15201 - 15300                          |
| Error                                   |  15301 - 15400                          |
