# Learning Resources

There are a tonne of great resources out there that cover event sourcing. Much of these helped inspire this library :heart:.

## :night_with_stars: Change Feed

The change feed is one of the core concepts of this library and is worth understanding. This will allow you to get the most out of this library and understand how it can be used in production scenarios.
