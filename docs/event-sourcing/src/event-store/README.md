# Event Store

The library provides a simple `interface` that allows you to interact with Azure Cosmos DB as an event store.

This interface is the `IEventStore<TEventItem>`, this allows you to save events, save aggregate roots that holds events. Read all events, stream events using `IAsyncEnumerable<T>` and query events to limit the set of events that are returned.

The event store also handles the polymorphic serialization and de-serialization. This is done via a customer `JsonConverter<T>`. This library currently uses `Newtonsoft.Json` as this is what the underlying Cosmos DB SDK supports as of writing this.
